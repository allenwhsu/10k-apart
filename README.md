# How small is this website?
Like, tiny. 9k, to be more specific. It is about half of the size of my Gitbun profile picture. This is the first website of mine that hits 100/100 on both Google and Pingdom's speed tests. You can view a live demo at allenwhsu.com/10k/.

# Why so small?

#About this site
This is my personal website that I am acutally using. I was able to optimize the site from 117 KB to 9KB while keeping the same design. Some subtle animations are removed.
